# Color-Recognizer
A basic application that will help us to detect the colors in an image. The program will also return the RGB values of the colors.

Since most of the colors can be defined using **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**. That is why we will use the RGB format as our data points. A ready .csv file with around 1000 color names and the RGB values can be found <a href="https://github.com/geekquad/Color-Recognizer/blob/master/colors.csv"> here</a>.
